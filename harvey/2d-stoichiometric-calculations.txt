A balanced reaction, which defines the stoichiometric relationship between
the moles of reactants and the moles of products, provides the basis for
many analytical calculations. Consider, for example, an analysis for oxalic
acid, H2C2O4, in which Fe3+ oxidizes oxalic acid to CO2
The balanced reaction shows us that one mole of oxalic acid reacts with two
moles of Fe3+. As shown in the following example, we can use this balanced
reaction to determine the amount of H2C2O4 in a sample of rhubarb if we
know the moles of Fe3+ needed to react completely with oxalic acid.

The analyte in Example 2.6, oxalic acid, is in a chemically useful form
because there is a reagent, Fe3+, that reacts with it quantitatively. In many
analytical methods, we first must convert the analyte into a more accessible
form before we can complete the analysis. For example, one method for
the quantitative analysis of disulfiram, C10H20N2S4—the active ingredient
in the drug Antabuse—requires that we first convert the sulfur to SO2 by
combustion, and then oxidize the SO2 to H2SO4 by bubbling it through a
solution of H2O2. When the conversion is complete, the amount of H2SO4
is determined by titrating with NaOH.

To convert the moles of NaOH used in the titration to the moles of
disulfiram in the sample, we need to know the stoichiometry of each reaction.
Writing a balanced reaction for H2SO4 and NaOH is straightforward

but the balanced reactions for the oxidations of C10H20N2S4 to SO2, and
of SO2 to H2SO4 are not as immediately obvious. Although we can balance
these redox reactions, it is often easier to deduce the overall stoichiometry
by use a little chemical logic.
