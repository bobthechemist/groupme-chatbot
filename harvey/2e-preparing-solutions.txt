2E Preparing Solutions

Preparing a solution of known concentration is perhaps the most common
activity in any analytical lab. The method for measuring out the solute and
the solvent depend on the desired concentration and how exact the solution’s
concentration needs to be known. Pipets and volumetric flasks are
used when we need to know a solution’s exact concentration; graduated cylinders,
beakers, and/or reagent bottles suffice when a concentrations need
only be approximate. Two methods for preparing solutions are described
in this section.

A stock solution is prepared by weighing out an appropriate portion of
a pure solid or by measuring out an appropriate volume of a pure liquid,
placing it in a suitable flask, and diluting to a known volume. Exactly how
one measure’s the reagent depends on the desired concentration unit. For
example, to prepare a solution with a known molarity you weigh out an appropriate
mass of the reagent, dissolve it in a portion of solvent, and bring
it to the desired volume. To prepare a solution where the solute’s concentration
is a volume percent, you measure out an appropriate volume of solute
and add sufficient solvent to obtain the desired total volume.

Solutions are often prepared by diluting a more concentrated stock solution.
A known volume of the stock solution is transferred to a new container
and brought to a new volume. Since the total amount of solute is the same
before and after dilution, we know that
where Co is the stock solution’s concentration, Vo is the volume of stock
solution being diluted, Cd is the dilute solution’s concentration, and Vd
is the volume of the dilute solution. Again, the type of glassware used to
measure Vo and Vd depends on how precisely we need to know the solution’s
concentration.

As shown in the following example, we can use equation 2.2 to calculate
a solution’s original concentration using its known concentration after
dilution.
