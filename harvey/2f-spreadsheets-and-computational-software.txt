Analytical chemistry is an quantitative discipline. Whether you are completing
a statistical analysis, trying to optimize experimental conditions, or
exploring how a change in pH affects a compound’s solubility, the ability to
work with complex mathematical equations is essential. Spreadsheets, such
as Microsoft Excel are an important tool for analyzing your data and for
preparing graphs of your results. Scattered throughout this textbook you
will find instructions for using spreadsheets.

Although spreadsheets are useful, they are not always well suited for
working with scientific data. If you plan to pursue a career in chemistry,
you may wish to familiarize yourself with a more sophisticated computational
software package, such as the freely available open-source program
that goes by the name R, or commercial programs such as Mathematica
or Matlab. You will find instructions for using R scattered throughout this
textbook.

Despite the power of spreadsheets and computational programs, don’t
forget that the most important software is behind your eyes and between your
ears. The ability to think intuitively about chemistry is a critically important
skill. In many cases you will find that it is possible to determine if an
analytical method is feasible or to approximate the optimum conditions
for an analytical method without resorting to complex calculations. Why
spend time developing a complex spreadsheet or writing software code
when a “back-of-the-envelope” estimate will do the trick? Once you know
the general solution to your problem, you can use a spreadsheet or a computational
program to work out the specifics. Throughout this textbook we
will introduce tools to help develop your ability to think intuitively.
