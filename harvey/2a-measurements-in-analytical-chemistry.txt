Analytical chemistry is a quantitative science. Whether determining the
concentration of a species, evaluating an equilibrium constant, measuring a
reaction rate, or drawing a correlation between a compound’s structure and
its reactivity, analytical chemists engage in “measuring important chemical
things.”1 In this section we review briefly the basic units of measurement
and the proper use of significant figures.

A measurement usually consists of a unit and a number that expresses the
quantity of that unit. We can express the same physical measurement with
different units, which creates confusion if we are not careful to specify the
unit. For example, the mass of a sample that weighs 1.5 g is equivalent to
0.0033 lb or to 0.053 oz. To ensure consistency, and to avoid problems,
scientists use the common set of fundamental base units listed in Table 2.1.
These units are called SI units after the Système International d’Unités.

We define other measurements using these fundamental SI units. For
example, we measure the quantity of heat produced during a chemical reaction
in joules, (J), where 1 J is equivalent to 1 m2kg/s2. Table 2.2 provides
a list of some important derived SI units, as well as a few common non-SI
units.

Chemists frequently work with measurements that are very large or very
small. A mole contains 602 213 670 000 000 000 000 000 particles and
some analytical techniques can detect as little as 0.000 000 000 000 001
g of a compound. For simplicity, we express these measurements using
scientific notation; thus, a mole contains 6.022 136 7 × 1023 particles,
and the detected mass is 1 × 10–15 g. Sometimes we wish to express a measurement
without the exponential term, replacing it with a prefix (Table
2.3). A mass of 1×10–15 g, for example, is the same as 1 fg, or femtogram.

A measurement provides information about both its magnitude and its
uncertainty. Consider, for example, the three photos in Figure 2.1, taken at
intervals of approximately 1 sec after placing a sample on the balance. Assuming
the balance is properly calibrated, we are certain that the sample’s
mass is more than 0.5729 g and less than 0.5731 g. We are uncertain,
however, about the sample’s mass in the last decimal place since the final
two decimal places fluctuate between 29, 30, and 31. The best we can do
is to report the sample’s mass as 0.5730 g ± 0.0001 g, indicating both its
magnitude and its absolute uncertainty.

Significant Figures

A measurement’s significant figures convey information about a measurement’s
magnitude and uncertainty. The number of significant figures in
a measurement is the number of digits known exactly plus one digit whose
value is uncertain. The mass shown in Figure 2.1, for example, has four
significant figures, three which we know exactly and one, the last, which
is uncertain.

Suppose we weigh a second sample, using the same balance, and obtain
a mass of 0.0990 g. Does this measurement have 3, 4, or 5 significant figures?
The zero in the last decimal place is the one uncertain digit and is significant.
The other two zero, however, simply indicate the decimal point’s
location. Writing the measurement in scientific notation (9.90 × 10–2)
clarifies that there are three significant figures in 0.0990.

There are two special cases when determining the number of significant
figures in a measurement. For a measurement given as a logarithm, such as
pH, the number of significant figures is equal to the number of digits to the
right of the decimal point. Digits to the left of the decimal point are not
significant figures since they indicate only the power of 10. A pH of 2.45,
therefore, contains two significant figures.

An exact number, such as a stoichiometric coefficient, has an infinite
number of significant figures. A mole of CaCl2, for example, contains exactly
two moles of chloride ions and one mole of calcium ions. Another
example of an exact number is the relationship between some units. There
are, for example, exactly 1000 mL in 1 L. Both the 1 and the 1000 have an
infinite number of significant figures.

Using the correct number of significant figures is important because it
tells other scientists about the uncertainty of your measurements. Suppose
you weigh a sample on a balance that measures mass to the nearest ±0.1 mg.
Reporting the sample’s mass as 1.762 g instead of 1.7623 g is incorrect because
it does not convey properly the measurement’s uncertainty. Reporting
the sample’s mass as 1.76231 g also is incorrect because it falsely suggests
an uncertainty of ±0.01 mg.

Significant figures are also important because they guide us when reporting
the result of an analysis. When we calculate a result, the answer cannot be
more certain than the least certain measurement in the analysis. Rounding
an answer to the correct number of significant figures is important.

For addition and subtraction, we round the answer to the last decimal
place in common for each measurement in the calculation. The exact sum
of 135.621, 97.33, and 21.2163 is 254.1673. Since the last decimal place
common to all three numbers is the hundredth’s place
we round the result to 254.17. When working with scientific notation,
first convert each measurement to a common exponent before determining
the number of significant figures. For example, the sum of 6.17 × 107,
4.3 × 105, and 3.23 × 104 is 6.22 × 107.

 For multiplication and division, we round the answer to the same number
of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest number of
significant figures. For example, when we divide the product of 22.91 and
0.152 by 16.302, we report the answer as 0.214 (three significant figures)
because 0.152 has the fewest number of significant figures.
There is no need to convert measurements in scientific notation to a common
exponent when multiplying or dividing.

Finally, to avoid “round-off” errors, it is a good idea to retain at least
one extra significant figure throughout any calculation. Better yet, invest in 
a good scientific calculator that allows you to perform lengthy calculations
without the need to record intermediate values. When your calculation is
complete, round the answer to the correct number of significant figures
using the following simple rules.

1. Retain the least significant figure if it and the digits that follow are less
than half way to the next higher digit. For example, rounding 12.442
to the nearest tenth gives 12.4 since 0.442 is less than half way between
0.400 and 0.500.

2. Increase the least significant figure by 1 if it and the digits that follow
are more than half way to the next higher digit. For example, rounding
12.476 to the nearest tenth gives 12.5 since 0.476 is more than half way
between 0.400 and 0.500.

3. If the least significant figure and the digits that follow are exactly halfway
to the next higher digit, then round the least significant figure to
the nearest even number. For example, rounding 12.450 to the nearest
tenth gives 12.4, while rounding 12.550 to the nearest tenth gives 12.6.
Rounding in this manner ensures that we round up as often as we round
down.
